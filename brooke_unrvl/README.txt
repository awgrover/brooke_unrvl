For the Universe is Calling project.

Files:

* "v44k1q05.img" the ogg recording profile. see datasheet/code.:w
* "hello.mp3" will be played when the handset is picked up. Mono please!
* Recorded responses look like: "000.ogg", "001.ogg" etc.
* The system uses the first possible file name for a response. E.g. if 000.ogg exists, it wil try to use 001.ogg. NB: if 000.ogg and 002.ogg exists, it will use 001.ogg!
* Things will probably crash when the card fills up.
